<h3>Java 8 Concurrency and Synchronization (Assignment 3a)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Overview of the Assignment</H4>

In this first part of assignment 3 you will use various Java 8
concurrency and synchronization mechanisms to develop an Android app
containing a resource manager that restricts the number of Beings from
Middle-Earth who can concurrently gaze into a fixed number of
Palantiri.  In particular, you'll gain experience with Java parallel
streams and various synchronization mechanisms (including Phasers and
StampedLocks), which we'll cover in class. <P>

This Android program is structured in accordance with the <A
HREf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View-Presenter</A>
(MVP) pattern.  The classes in the View layer are provided to you.
The main PalantiriActivity first prompts the user to enter various
configuration parameters, such as the number of Palantiri and Beings.
It then starts the GazingSimulationActivity, which initializes the
Presenter layer and then starts the Presenter layer's processing
logic.  The bulk of the concurrent processing is performed by the
Presenter and Model layers.  If you correctly complete the
implementation of skeletons in these layers the Palantiri app should
run successfully without throwing any exceptions. <P>

<H4>Assignment Structure</H4>

The assignment is split into the following three directories:

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/main">app/src/main</A>, which conains the
skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>.  You'll need to open this project in
Android Studio. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a JUnit test that
exercises all the PalantiriManager features and can be used to help
test the functionality created in the assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio test that runs your app automatically.  You'll
automatically import this project into Android Studio. <P>
</UL>

To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. If you do not
have one created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager"
button in the Android Studio IDE. <P>

<P><HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Program Description</H4>

In the <CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy</CODE> directory you'll find
a number of files, all of which you should read.  You'll need to
modify several files containing the skeleton Java code that you'll
implement by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" comments to
provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF
THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO -- You fill in here" portions!!!
<P>

In particular, you'll need to do the following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> Finish the implementation of certain methods in the
<CODE>PalantiriPresenter.java</CODE> and
<CODE>BeingRunnable.java</CODE> defined by the Presenter layer
residing in <CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/presenter</CODE>.
You'll need to (1) complete the <CODE>shutdown()</CODE>,
<CODE>start()</CODE>, <CODE>beginBeingsGazing()</CODE>,
<CODE>waitForBeingsToFinishGazing()</CODE> methods in
<CODE>PalantiriPresenter.java</CODE> and (2) complete the
<CODE>shutdown()</CODE>, <CODE>isShutdown()</CODE>,
<CODE>run()</CODE>, <CODE>gazeIntoPalantir()</CODE>,
<CODE>incrementGazingCountAndCheck()</CODE>, and
<CODE>decrementGazingCount()</CODE> methods in
<CODE>BeingRunnable.java</CODE> to handle updates and cancellations to
the GUI. You'll need to understand how Java Phasers and
CountDownLatches work, which are described in videos <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N00XaMuhHhE">here</A> and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6LTKKTh_FA">here</A>,
respectively. <P>

<LI> You'll need to finish the implementation of the Model layer in
<CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/model/PalantiriManager.java</CODE>.
Undergraduates will use a Java Semaphore, a HashMap, and a Java
RentrantReadWriteLocks to mediate concurrent access to the Palantiri
resources and keep track of which Palantiri are currently free and
which are in use. In contrast, graduates (or those taking the course
for graduate credit) must use a Java Semaphore, a HashMap, and a Java
8 StampedLock to mediate concurrent access to the Palantiri resources
and keep track of which Palantiri are currently free and which are in
use. A video describing Java ReentrantReadWriteLocks and StampedLocks
appears <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDAM2J44ZnE">here</A>.<P>

<LI> Make sure to use Java 8 features (such as lambda expressions,
method references, and sequential streams) where ever possible in your
solution.  </UL>
</UL>

Your app will be considered "correct" if it successfully completes a
simulation of N Palantiri and M Beings without crashing or throwing
any exceptions. The Palantir and Beings are color coded to represent
their state: <P>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Beings</B> - Yellow means the Being is idle, Red means it's
waiting to acquire a Palantir, Green means it's gazing into a
Palantir, and Purple means the gazing was interrupted due to the lease
expiring.<P> 

<LI> <B>Palantiri</B> - Gray means the Palantir is inactive, Green
means it is available for use, and Red means it is in use (i.e., a
Being is currently gazing into it).<P>

</UL>

A "correct" simulation should restrict the number of gazing Beings to
the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there are four Palantiri
in the simulation, then only four Being dots should ever be Green on
the screen at a time. <P>

<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

Skeleton code for this first part of the assignment is available from
my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS282/tree/master/assignments/assignment3/A3a-ParallelStreams">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. The additional work required by graduate students is
clearly marked. <P>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

This assignment is designed to help you gain experience with more
powerful Java concurrency mechanisms, such as Java 8 parallel streams,
StampedLocks, and Phasers.  It doesn't require you to program any
Android communication frameworks, which we'll cover in an upcoming
assignment. <P>
