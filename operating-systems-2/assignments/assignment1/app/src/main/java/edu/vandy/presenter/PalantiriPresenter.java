/**
 * This class manages the Palantiri simulation.  The simulation begins
 * in the start() method, which is called by the UI Thread and is
 * provided a reference to MVP.RequiredViewOps, which is used to
 * manipulate the UI.  The Options singleton contains the number of
 * beings to simulate and the number of palantiri to simulate.
 * 
 * The simulation should run as follows: the correct number of
 * palantiri should be instantiated and added to the LeasePool in the
 * Model layer.  A Java thread should be created for each Being.  Each
 * Being thread should attempt to acquire a palantir a certain number
 * of times (defined via the GAZE_ATTEMPTS constant below).  As this
 * is happening, Being threads should call the appropriate methods in
 * MVP.RequiredViewOps to demonstrate which palantiri are being used
 * and which Beings currently own a palantir.
 *
 * This class plays the "Presenter" role in the Model-View-Presenter
 * (MVP) pattern by acting upon the Model and the View, i.e., it
 * retrieves data from the Model (e.g., PalantiriModel) and formats it
 * for display in the View (e.g., PalantiriActivity).  It expends the
 * GenericPresenter superclass and implements MVP.ProvidedPresenterOps
 * and MVP.RequiredModelOps so it can be created/managed by the
 * GenericPresenter framework.
