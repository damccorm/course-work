# Vanderbilt Course Work

Projects from my undergraduate/masters classes at Vanderbilt. Most of these were originally housed in https://github.com/dannymccormick3, I moved them here for convenience and to consolidate.

## Highlights

* [Research Paper](https://github.com/damccorm/course-work/blob/master/research/Distributed%20algorithms%20for%20chordal%20and%20comparability%20graph%20classes%20and%20subclasses.pdf) - Novel distributed algorithms for recognition of chordal graphs, recognition of comparability graphs, and construction of interval graphs. This includes an implementation of distributed Lexicographic Breadth First Search (LBFS).

* [Predicting Diagnoses of Alzheimer's Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/damccorm/course-work/tree/master/machine-learning/Project) - Uses features derived from brain images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to predict whether a person has Alzheimer's. Implemented 4 classifiers and achieved >99% accuracy on the test set using KNN.

* [PBFT Raft Implementation](https://github.com/damccorm/course-work/tree/master/Dependable-and-Resilient-Computing/PBFTRaft) - 
Implementation of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Raft algorithm. Can achieve consensus and is tolerant to **n** adversarial nodes given **>= 3n + 1** nodes. This has been proven to be the best a consensus algorithm can do in the presence of adversarial nodes.

## Disclaimer

Not all code in this repo was written by me. Some were team projects and some were assignments with some existing code. Complete git history can be found in the original repos.
