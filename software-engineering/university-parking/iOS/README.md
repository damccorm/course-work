# Setup instructions for the iOS app:

----
## Cocoa Pods should be installed:
see [CocoaPods' website for details](https://cocoapods.org/)

After installing CocoaPods, navigate into the "University Parking" directory where the Podfile is located.

Execute the command `pod install`

After some time, a .xcworkspace file should have been generated. Click on this to open the application in XCode.

----
## Usage
1. Select iPhone 8 Plus as the device.
2. Run the app!

As always, one could decide to run the application on their own iDevice; this option is in the same drop-down menu as "iPhone 8 Plus" and the rest of the simulators.
